# Project notes for Claude

## Follow-up: Repast reference paper (logged 2026-09-18, revisit after ELF port is solid)

User asked whether to adopt Repast Simphony/HPC for the human/deer agents.
Conclusion: **no** — Repast is a Java (Simphony) or MPI-cluster (HPC) toolkit;
adopting it would mean a language/runtime rewrite for no real gain, since our
simpler ELF-derived scheduler/grid already fits this project's actual needs
(single process, real-time, tightly coupled to the Kinect/openFrameworks
render loop).

User then shared a real reference paper: Guest, Bernardes, Howard (2022,
University of Georgia AGU poster) - "Integration of an Agent-Based Model and
Augmented Reality for Immersive Modeling Exploration." It describes a
Repast Simphony + Tangible Landscape (GRASS GIS) + Kinect AR sandbox running
a sheep/wolf/grass predator-prey ABM: DEM captured from sand and fed into
Repast, agent movement constrained by elevation/slope with a slope-based
energy cost, and "Population Over Time" line charts (species counts vs.
tick) as the primary output across four terrain scenarios.

**Do NOT adopt Repast or its stack** - the DEM-ingestion pipeline (GRASS
GIS/Tangible Landscape) is irrelevant since we already read depth natively
via KinectProjector/SandSurfaceRenderer. But the paper validates three
features as worth building natively in our own C++/ImGui, once the ELF
port itself is verified working on hardware:

1. **Population-over-time chart** - ImGui line plot (ImPlot or
   `ImGui::PlotLines`) fed by a ring buffer sampled once per `update()`:
   human/deer counts, vegetation totals per species. Doubles as the
   diagnostic for the still-unconfirmed hypothesis that agents strip
   vegetation faster than it can regrow (see below).
2. **Live agent inspection/probes** - click-to-inspect panel bound to a
   `Critter`/`HumanAgent`'s live fields (position, food/hunger, target,
   state) - equivalent to Repast Simphony's Agent Viewer, no dependency
   needed.
3. **Reproducible logging** - CSV export from the same per-tick sampler
   (tick, counts, RNG seed) - equivalent to Repast's data-set recorders.

The slope-based movement energy cost from the paper is a plausible design
reference for the *future succession-model phase* (Xun Liu's paper), not
something to port now.

**Do not start implementing any of this until the ELF port itself is
confirmed working properly on real hardware** - that's the current
priority per the user's explicit instruction (2026-09-18).

## Open technical thread: vegetation growth vs. consumption balance

Confirmed by reading ELF's actual source
(`BDenvironment.java`/`BDlocation.java` in the ELFdev001/ELFDynamicSystem
clone):

- **Eating is instant and total in ELF too.** `BDenvironment.java`'s human
  and deer eating loops (~lines 210-221, 300-325) take 100% of whatever
  shrub/fruit/nut density is present at an agent's cell in one step and
  zero it out - no minimum threshold, no partial bite. Our port's
  `eatShrubOrFruit()`/`eatFruitOrNut()` doing the same thing is faithful
  to ELF, not a bug.
- **Growth, however, is NOT continuous in ELF - it's a slow per-tick coin
  flip.** `BDlocation.growShrubs()`/`growFruits()`/`growNuts()` each do a
  `Math.random()*100 < GROWTH` check per tick and, on success, increment
  density by exactly 1 out of a 0..255 max (SHRUBGROWTH=1,
  FRUITGROWTH=3, NUTGROWTH=2 - i.e. 1%/3%/2% chance per tick of +1/255).
  Reaching full density takes on the order of tens of thousands of ticks.
- **RESOLVED (`0afa62f`, 2026-09-18) - reverted to ELF's literal per-tick
  mechanic, per the user's explicit decision.** Was continuous
  (`density += GROWTH_RATE * dt`), an earlier session's unprompted
  smoothness call at the very first vegetation commit (`86b416f`) never
  put to the user as a decision - see git history if the full backstory
  is needed again. Now `VegetationField.cpp`'s `update()` does
  `ofRandom(100.0f) < SHRUB_GROWTH_CHANCE_PCT` (etc., values 1.0/3.0/2.0,
  ELF's literal SHRUBGROWTH/FRUITGROWTH/NUTGROWTH) once per cell per
  frame, incrementing by exactly 1/255 on success - one `update()` call
  is one ELF tick, matching Critter/HumanAgent's existing convention.
  Reasoning given: start from a known-ELF-faithful baseline to diagnose
  the "vegetation never grows" problem from, then customize from there.
  **Important expectation-setting for the next hardware test:** this is
  ELF's actual glacial pace - full density takes on the order of tens of
  thousands of ticks. A short test (seconds, even a minute or two) is
  expected to show little to no visible growth even if everything else
  is working correctly now. Use the pipeline/band diagnostics added in
  `58d1890` (Vegetation panel: stabilized/ROI/gridReady gate states, and
  the ROI-center cell's live band/density readout) to confirm the
  mechanism is actually running and rolling the dice, rather than
  waiting a long time and judging only by whether color appears.
- **RESOLVED - grazing pressure is not the cause.** User ran the proposed
  test (removed all deer/humans via the Population panel, waited) on a
  build before the white->black negative-space change. Result: still
  just blank white, no visible vegetation. With zero agents there is
  nothing left to strip cells bare, so growth itself is not happening at
  any rate - the "~120 agents outrunning regrowth" hypothesis is dead.
  Whatever's wrong is upstream of agents entirely.
- **Open, more fundamental question this reopens:** is elevation ever
  landing inside a growth band at all, or is the vegetation pipeline
  itself not engaging? Blank white is ambiguous in this shader - it's
  both the "nothing grown yet" base color AND the flat snow color when
  `debugShowSnow` is off - so "blank white" alone doesn't distinguish
  "no band ever satisfied" from "everything reads as snow" from "the
  overlay isn't wired up." Follow-ups asked of the user (2026-09-18,
  awaiting answer): (1) was there ANY variation at all - contour lines,
  water tint - or literally uniform flat white everywhere; (2) was the
  debug-snow toggle (`08a810a`) on during this test, and if so was the
  pale-blue snow tint ever visible; (3) what did the Vegetation panel's
  live readouts show (raw elevation at ROI center, water/snow line mm,
  calibrated ceiling, band widths) at the time; (4) which build/commit
  was this tested on. This is now a higher-priority thread than the
  growth-mechanic question above, since it may be the same root cause
  as the earlier "no height map at all" reports rather than anything
  vegetation-specific.
