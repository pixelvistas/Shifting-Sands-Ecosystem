# Project notes for Claude

## Structural fidelity audit vs. ELF source (2026-09-18)

Full side-by-side re-read of our C++ port against ELF's actual Java
source (`BDenvironment.java`/`BDagent.java`/`BDdeer.java`/`BDlocation.java`
in the ELFdev001/ELFDynamicSystem clone), covering movement, eating,
fishing, hunting, spawn/death/corpse constants, and population caps -
not just the growth mechanic covered above. Confirmed accurate: deer's
permissive-OR movement rule, humans' wait/stutter-step rule, all
water/snow/growth band thresholds, eating gated on `food < MAX_FOOD`,
fishing/hunting chance-equals-skill mechanics, the literal (not "fixed")
`fruittaken + nutstaken/100` gathering formula, and all spawn/death/
corpse constants (`LIFE_OF_CORPSE=500`, `SPAWN_CHANCE_PER_TICK=1.0`,
etc.). Population cap (60/60 vs. ELF's literal `MAXAGENTS/MAXDEERS=1000`)
is a documented, deliberate adaptation for real-time draw cost - already
flagged as intentional in `CritterController.h`, not a new finding.

**Found and fixed (`e94d39f`): update order was backwards.**
`CritterController::update()` updated deer before humans, with a
comment claiming this matched ELF - it didn't. `BDenvironment.step()`
literally calls `stepAgents()` then `stepDeer()` every tick; re-reading
it directly (not trusting the existing comment) confirmed humans go
first in real ELF. Swapped to match: humans now update first, so a
hunt this tick checks each deer's end-of-previous-tick position, same
as ELF, instead of a position the deer moved to later in the same tick.

**Documented, per explicit user instruction, as intentional (not
reverted):** two places where the port is more correct than ELF's own
literal arithmetic rather than reproducing it bug-for-bug:
- Food is clamped at `MAX_FOOD` on eating; ELF's `stepAgents()`/
  `stepDeer()` add with no cap at all (a big tile can overshoot 255).
- Fishing/hunting skill is clamped at 100; ELF's `setFishing()`/
  `setHunting()` have a real bug (unclamped value written to the field
  before a clamp is computed on a local copy that's never written
  back), so skill is actually unbounded in real ELF.

Both are now called out in code comments (`Critter.cpp`/
`HumanAgent.cpp`) as deliberate deviations rather than left silent.

## Follow-up: Repast reference paper (logged 2026-09-18, revisit after ELF port is solid)

User asked whether to adopt Repast Simphony/HPC for the human/deer agents.
Conclusion: **no** — Repast is a Java (Simphony) or MPI-cluster (HPC) toolkit;
adopting it would mean a language/runtime rewrite for no real gain, since our
simpler ELF-derived scheduler/grid already fits this project's actual needs
(single process, real-time, tightly coupled to the Kinect/openFrameworks
render loop).

User then shared a real reference paper: Guest, Bernardes, Howard (2022,
University of Georgia AGU poster) - "Integration of an Agent-Based Model and
Augmented Reality for Immersive Modeling Exploration." It describes a
Repast Simphony + Tangible Landscape (GRASS GIS) + Kinect AR sandbox running
a sheep/wolf/grass predator-prey ABM: DEM captured from sand and fed into
Repast, agent movement constrained by elevation/slope with a slope-based
energy cost, and "Population Over Time" line charts (species counts vs.
tick) as the primary output across four terrain scenarios.

**Do NOT adopt Repast or its stack** - the DEM-ingestion pipeline (GRASS
GIS/Tangible Landscape) is irrelevant since we already read depth natively
via KinectProjector/SandSurfaceRenderer. But the paper validates three
features as worth building natively in our own C++/ImGui, once the ELF
port itself is verified working on hardware:

1. **Population-over-time chart** - ImGui line plot (ImPlot or
   `ImGui::PlotLines`) fed by a ring buffer sampled once per `update()`:
   human/deer counts, vegetation totals per species. Doubles as the
   diagnostic for the still-unconfirmed hypothesis that agents strip
   vegetation faster than it can regrow (see below).
2. **Live agent inspection/probes** - click-to-inspect panel bound to a
   `Critter`/`HumanAgent`'s live fields (position, food/hunger, target,
   state) - equivalent to Repast Simphony's Agent Viewer, no dependency
   needed.
3. **Reproducible logging** - CSV export from the same per-tick sampler
   (tick, counts, RNG seed) - equivalent to Repast's data-set recorders.

**Independent confirmation that #1 isn't just a Repast borrowing:** during
the 2026-09-19 structural audit, `BDdisplay.java` in ELF's own source
turned out to be a 7-line unimplemented stub:

```java
public class BDdisplay {
  //TODO function for displaying output data on top of environment
  //TODO need to add, population data, patches, animals and trees
  //TODO also potentially add some output graphs that update as the
  //     simulation is running
}
```

ELF's own authors planned a population/output-graph display and never
built it - `BDframe`/`BDenvironment` never reference this class at all,
so it's dead scaffolding, not a feature that shipped. The population-
over-time chart above is therefore finishing an ELF design intent left
undone, not just adapting something from the Repast/Tangible Landscape
paper - two independent sources (ELF's own TODO and Guest/Bernardes/
Howard's working implementation) now point at the same feature.

The slope-based movement energy cost from the paper is a plausible design
reference for the *future succession-model phase* (Xun Liu's paper), not
something to port now.

**Do not start implementing any of this until the ELF port itself is
confirmed working properly on real hardware** - that's the current
priority per the user's explicit instruction (2026-09-18).

## Open technical thread: vegetation growth vs. consumption balance

Confirmed by reading ELF's actual source
(`BDenvironment.java`/`BDlocation.java` in the ELFdev001/ELFDynamicSystem
clone):

- **Eating is instant and total in ELF too.** `BDenvironment.java`'s human
  and deer eating loops (~lines 210-221, 300-325) take 100% of whatever
  shrub/fruit/nut density is present at an agent's cell in one step and
  zero it out - no minimum threshold, no partial bite. Our port's
  `eatShrubOrFruit()`/`eatFruitOrNut()` doing the same thing is faithful
  to ELF, not a bug.
- **Growth, however, is NOT continuous in ELF - it's a slow per-tick coin
  flip.** `BDlocation.growShrubs()`/`growFruits()`/`growNuts()` each do a
  `Math.random()*100 < GROWTH` check per tick and, on success, increment
  density by exactly 1 out of a 0..255 max (SHRUBGROWTH=1,
  FRUITGROWTH=3, NUTGROWTH=2 - i.e. 1%/3%/2% chance per tick of +1/255).
  Reaching full density takes on the order of tens of thousands of ticks.
- **RESOLVED (`0afa62f`, 2026-09-18) - reverted to ELF's literal per-tick
  mechanic, per the user's explicit decision.** Was continuous
  (`density += GROWTH_RATE * dt`), an earlier session's unprompted
  smoothness call at the very first vegetation commit (`86b416f`) never
  put to the user as a decision - see git history if the full backstory
  is needed again. Now `VegetationField.cpp`'s `update()` does
  `ofRandom(100.0f) < SHRUB_GROWTH_CHANCE_PCT` (etc., values 1.0/3.0/2.0,
  ELF's literal SHRUBGROWTH/FRUITGROWTH/NUTGROWTH) once per cell per
  frame, incrementing by exactly 1/255 on success - one `update()` call
  is one ELF tick, matching Critter/HumanAgent's existing convention.
  Reasoning given: start from a known-ELF-faithful baseline to diagnose
  the "vegetation never grows" problem from, then customize from there.
  **Important expectation-setting for the next hardware test:** this is
  ELF's actual glacial pace - full density takes on the order of tens of
  thousands of ticks. A short test (seconds, even a minute or two) is
  expected to show little to no visible growth even if everything else
  is working correctly now. Use the pipeline/band diagnostics added in
  `58d1890` (Vegetation panel: stabilized/ROI/gridReady gate states, and
  the ROI-center cell's live band/density readout) to confirm the
  mechanism is actually running and rolling the dice, rather than
  waiting a long time and judging only by whether color appears.
- **RESOLVED - grazing pressure is not the cause.** User ran the proposed
  test (removed all deer/humans via the Population panel, waited) on a
  build before the white->black negative-space change. Result: still
  just blank white, no visible vegetation. With zero agents there is
  nothing left to strip cells bare, so growth itself is not happening at
  any rate - the "~120 agents outrunning regrowth" hypothesis is dead.
  Whatever's wrong is upstream of agents entirely.
- **Open, more fundamental question this reopens:** is elevation ever
  landing inside a growth band at all, or is the vegetation pipeline
  itself not engaging? Blank white is ambiguous in this shader - it's
  both the "nothing grown yet" base color AND the flat snow color when
  `debugShowSnow` is off - so "blank white" alone doesn't distinguish
  "no band ever satisfied" from "everything reads as snow" from "the
  overlay isn't wired up." Follow-ups asked of the user (2026-09-18,
  awaiting answer): (1) was there ANY variation at all - contour lines,
  water tint - or literally uniform flat white everywhere; (2) was the
  debug-snow toggle (`08a810a`) on during this test, and if so was the
  pale-blue snow tint ever visible; (3) what did the Vegetation panel's
  live readouts show (raw elevation at ROI center, water/snow line mm,
  calibrated ceiling, band widths) at the time; (4) which build/commit
  was this tested on. This is now a higher-priority thread than the
  growth-mechanic question above, since it may be the same root cause
  as the earlier "no height map at all" reports rather than anything
  vegetation-specific.
